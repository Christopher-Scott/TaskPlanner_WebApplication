                <strong>Easily keep track of your assignments, tasks, and goals!</strong>           
                
                This site will provide a simple list based assignment or task planner.
                Each user can enter a text description and an associated due date when creating a new entry.
                At a later date tasks will be sortable based upon due date or other parameters.  Entries could even
                be used for notes, similar to <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a>.

            <!-- Description of database table -->   
            <p>
                The database table will consist of the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                
                <li>A due date specified by the user associated with this entry</li>
                <li>A text description of the assignment/task</li>
                <li>A record of the user(not entered by user) as a foreign key</li>
            </ul>
            
            <!-- Description of web dev experience -->
            <h2>Web Development Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I have limited web development experience.  I completed a Lynda tutorial on HTML, and feel reasonably comfortable
                with the different tags and structure.  The tutorial did include some basic CSS and Javascript, 
                however the information was restricted to what was necessary for the module.  
                Thus my experience with CSS is less, and will require looking up the syntax
                more frequently.  I know only the basics of Javascript syntax and am confident it will not be terribly difficult
                to pick up based on my experience with other programming languages.
            </p>
            <!-- What was easy, hard, and valuable about this HW -->
            <h2>About this Assignment</h2>
            <p>
               I found this assignment relatively straight-forward until I started the CSS styling.  
               Constructing the HTML structure went smoothly, and I did not have to look up much to accomplish my goals.
               When creating the styling for the page, I had to look up much more from W3schools to find syntax or the exact property
               I needed.  I also ran into an issue when setting the titleNav to be fixed and styled properly.  When I added background colors
               to my div they were not displaying, the titleNav was not fixed despite the CSS code being correct, and the flex-box was not
               responding properly.  The bug ended up being very simple.  I had a typo in the div ID.  My CSS code was fine, but was not being applied
               because the selector didn't have the typo.  I learned that I don't have efficient debugging behaviors established yet for web development.
               Next time when my styles aren't working, I'll check the selector and ID/Class first.
