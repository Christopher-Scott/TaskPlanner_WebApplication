        <p>           
            My component is a Calendar for visualizing date associated data.  It provides two ways of visualizing
            the data. An accordion effect enhances the visual appeal of the component's two data views.
            The first is an expanding week view that holds a title or some other small piece of data.               
            The second view I have called a 'spotlight'.  It allows more detail to be displayed about a selected day.
            Listed below are the available input parameters:
        </p>
        <pre>
            {array}  objList - a list of the data objects to insert into the calendar
            {string} datePropName - the date property name for objects in objList. Date must be in mm/dd/yyyy format
            {string} datumPropName - the data property name for objects in objList
            {string} detailPropName - the details property name for objects in objList
            {string} imgPropName - Optional. Property name of an image URL for objects in objList
    
            {function} formatSpotlight - Optional function to be called when formatting data added to spotlight  
    
            {string} className - an HTML class name to be associated with the returned component
            {string} activeClass - an HTML class name to be associated with active elements in the component
            {string} highlightClass - an HTML class name to be associated with highlighted elements in the component
        </pre>
        <p>
            Instead of hard coding styles for selected(active) elements I chose to use a combination of 3 HTML coder
            specified class names.  "className" is applied to the component itself, while "activeClass" 
            and "highlightClass" are applied to elements based on user events.  Since this component could display
            a variety of different data shifting the styling to an external sheet increases the flexibility of
            the component.
            <br>
            "formatSpotlight" is a an optional user-defined function that takes an object as a parameter and returns
            a string with the data formatted as the user desires.  This custom function allows the user to specify any
            HTML structure required for displaying their data without affecting the operation of the component.                        
        </p>
        <h3>Code Segments</h3>
        <p>
            One of the most fundamental elements of my component was calculating the day of week for the 1st of the
            month and the number of days in the specified month.  
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=GK8SVTXPLNCR">This demo</a> shows
            how I used methods of the JS date object to do get the values for my calculation.

                The original inspiration for this component.  I deviated heavily from the code outlined here to better
                accomplish my goals for the component.

                A link to the accordion effect page.  I really liked the smooth transition and how the effect
                could be used to turn a simple looking page into one displaying lots of information.

                I interacted with the JS Date object a lot for this project, and the documentation was crucial for understanding
                what could be accomplished with it.
